## 🗂️ Database Design

### 🧩 Entities
- **User**
- **Property**
- **Booking**
- **Review**
- **Payment**

### 🔑 Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (One-to-Many).
- A **Booking** belongs to a **Property** and is made by a **User**.
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
- Each **Review** is linked to both a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is associated with a specific **Booking**.

### 📌 Key Fields (Examples)
#### User
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`

#### Property
- `id`, `title`, `location`, `price`, `user_id`

#### Booking
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`

#### Review
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`

#### Payment
- `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `paid_at`

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management  
User management is a critical component of the platform. It includes features like user registration, login, email verification, authorization, and session management to ensure secure access and personalized experiences.

### 🏠 Property Management  
Hosts can list properties with detailed descriptions, pricing, and availability. This feature enables dynamic control over property visibility and data updates.

### 📅 Booking System  
The booking system is the core of the project. It allows users to reserve properties, track booking status, manage dates, and receive confirmations—streamlining the reservation process for both guests and hosts.

### ⭐ Rating & Review System  
Users can rate and review properties after their stay. This feature promotes trust and transparency by helping future guests make informed decisions.

### 💳 Payment Processing  
Secure payment processing enables users to complete bookings with integrated payment gateways. It supports real-time transaction handling, receipts, and refund capabilities where applicable.


## 🔐 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is vital for maintaining user trust, preventing data breaches, and ensuring the integrity of transactions. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### ✅ Authentication  
Users must prove their identity before accessing protected resources using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This helps prevent unauthorized access and impersonation.

### ✅ Authorization  
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users only access features and data they are permitted to. For example, a guest shouldn't access host-only features or admin controls.

### ✅ Rate Limiting  
Protects the API from abuse, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service (DoS) attempts by limiting the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a given time.

### ✅ Data Validation & Sanitization  
Every input from the user is validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### ✅ HTTPS Enforcement  
All API communication will be secured over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

### ✅ Secure Payment Handling  
All payment transactions are handled through trusted third-party providers, ensuring sensitive data like card information is never stored or mishandled.

By implementing these measures, the project ensures that user data, booking records, and payment details remain confidential, accurate, and protected from malicious threats.


## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) ensures that all changes to the codebase are automatically tested and deployed, improving code quality and accelerating development.

### 📌 Key Benefits:
- **Early Bug Detection:** Automated tests run with each code push to prevent broken features.
- **Fast Feedback Loop:** Developers get immediate feedback on changes.
- **Reliable Deployment:** Automates the deployment process, reducing human errors and ensuring consistency across environments.

### 🧰 Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions** – for automating workflows such as testing, building, and deployment.
- **Docker** – for creating consistent development and production environments.
- **Heroku / Render / Railway (or any cloud platform)** – for deploying the application live.

By using CI/CD pipelines, the Airbnb Clone project maintains high code quality, minimizes downtime, and ensures a smooth developer experience.
